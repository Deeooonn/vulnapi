The "JWT Null Signature" vulnerability occurs when a JSON Web Token (JWT) lacks a signature part, allowing attackers to manipulate the token's content potentially leading to unauthorized access and data tampering.

This vulnerability is similar to the "JWT Blank Secret" vulnerability, but in this case, the token lacks a signature part, making it easier for attackers to manipulate the token's content.

## Example

Here is a valid JWT signed with EdDSA algorithm (this will work with any algorithm like HS512, RS256, ...etc):

```bash copy
eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MjkxNTU4MDksImlhdCI6MTcyOTE1MjIwOSwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwic3ViIjoiMmNiMzA3YmEtYmI0Ni00MTk0LTg1NGYtNDc3NDA0NmQ5YzliIn0.
```

This decoded JWT contains, this parts:

```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

```json
{
  "iat": 1729155809,
  "exp": 1729155809,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "sub": "2cb307ba-bb46-4194-854f-4774046d9c9b"
}
```

The following JWT is signed with an empty secret:

```bash copy
eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MjkxNTU4MDksImlhdCI6MTcyOTE1MjIwOSwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwic3ViIjoiMmNiMzA3YmEtYmI0Ni00MTk0LTg1NGYtNDc3NDA0NmQ5YzliIn0.kZegpmCCFtxSUFNzjQHMMooPBhAPxsEB4pq4Ix75V9stP4Rq-UXj8yIO8OV-XCzHcbgld-ShbXy27lWE-S4TDg
```

## How to test?

If you want to test only the "JWT Null Signature" vulnerability, you can use the following command:

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'OpenAPI', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
echo "vulnapi scan curl [url] -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiI..." --scans jwt.null_signature
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
echo "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiI..." | vulnapi scan openapi [OpenAPI_Path_Or_URL] --scans jwt.null_signature
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
echo "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiI..." | vulnapi scan graphql -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiI..." --scans jwt.null_signature [url]
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

VulnAPI supports scanning against various types of other JWT vulnerabilities as well.

## What is the impact?

Signing a JWT with a null signature has a significant impact on the security of the token. A null signature means that there is no signature part used to sign the token, making it vulnerable to tampering and unauthorized access.

By manipulating the token's content, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, impersonate users, and perform other malicious activities.

## How to remediate?

To remediate the "JWT Null Signature" vulnerability, you should ensure that all JWTs are verified with a valid signature before processing them.

Here are some best practices to follow:
- Always use a strong cryptographic algorithm like HS512, RS512, or EdDSA to sign JWTs.
- Ensure that the secret key used to sign JWTs is kept secure and not exposed to unauthorized users.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from injecting malicious content into JWTs.
- Regularly monitor and audit JWTs to detect any unauthorized access or tampering attempts.
